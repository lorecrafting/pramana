## Where we are

**Phase 0 COMPLETE and gated.** Tagged `phase-0`.

The end-to-end path works: acquire → normalize → segment → load → resolve → verify,
with an MCP server on top. A model can fetch an exact Lotus Sūtra passage by URN and
the guard byte-compares its quote.

### Verified, not just built

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Nothing lost in normalization | 5374 lines == 5374 body `<lb>`; 941 attached + 4 unanchored == 945 == raw `<app>` |
| Citations are unique | all 5374 line anchors distinct; all URNs parse |
| Spans are byte-verifiable | all 5341 segments' byte offsets slice their exact content out of the body |
| The bake is reproducible | `mix pramana.verify --all`: body re-normalized from `raw/` is **byte-identical** to stored |
| The guard actually catches things | fabricated URN refused; 譯→說 single-character alteration caught, over the wire |

### Gate results

- `mix format --check-formatted` clean
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` clean
- **148 tests** passing (128 domain / 13 web / 7 native)
- `mix credo --strict` — 69 checks, 0 issues
- **`mix dialyzer` — 0 errors**
- `mix deps.audit` — no vulnerabilities
- `mix pramana.verify --all` — 1 text, 5341 segments, byte-identical
- Architecture review: all seven invariants hold (see below)

### Architecture review, Phase 0

- **#1** `pramana_web` touches `Repo` in **0 files** — the web layer goes through the
  domain. Every MCP response is `Response.json` or `Response.error`, never prose.
- **#2** URNs are built from each tradition's own citation grammar; no invented IDs.
- **#3** `raw/` is gitignored and nothing from it is committed; `mix pramana.bake`
  verifies `raw/` against the lockfile *before* trusting a byte of it.
- **#4** Provenance is CHECK-constrained columns (`composition_origin_known`,
  `text_role_known`), indexed, never a single source string.
- **#5** Deterministic throughout Phase 0; no LLM in the pipeline yet.
- **#6** No retrieval yet, so no evals yet. Phase 4 owns this.
- **#7** Wired in `Guard.citable_as_source/1` and tested via `check_span/3` with a
  synthetic span, so it is not retrofitted in Phase 3.
- No `priv/embed` sidecar exists yet — correct for Phase 0.

## Next

Phase 1, task #9 (full CBETA ingest via Broadway + Oban). Tasks #10–#12 follow, then
the Phase 1 gate (#13).

## Decisions taken

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Name: **Pramāṇa** | "Valid means of knowledge." The name is the thesis; survives the medical-text expansion, which `dharma-*` would not. |
| Open-source, self-hosted | We publish the **pipeline, not the corpus**. Keeps CBETA's non-commercial clause and BDRC's restrictions out of our distribution. |
| All four traditions in v1 | Tibetan is the acknowledged long pole and the designated thing to cut if the schedule slips. |
| One Postgres | The predicate-plus-vector query is the most important query in the system. |
| MCP + HTTP API first, UI last | Makes the Phase 8 reader a renderer rather than a second implementation. |
| Elixir/Phoenix, 3 exceptions | See `docs/ELIXIR.md`. |
| Native Postgres, not Docker | The bake reads hundreds of thousands of small files; container FS on macOS is the slow path. `docs/DEV_ENV.md`. |
| **MCP library: `anubis_mcp`** | `hermes_mcp`'s last release was 2025-08-14 (a year stale); `anubis_mcp` 2.0.0 shipped 2026-08-07 with ~7× the daily downloads. The fork is maintained; hand-rolling JSON-RPC is no longer warranted. |
| **Segments carry char AND byte offsets** | Char offsets are for clients (multi-byte CJK); byte offsets are for the server (`binary_part/3` is O(1) vs `String.slice/3` O(n)). Verifying T0262 went 18.5s → 1.7s, and the guard resolves spans on every answer. |
| **Embeddings: dense in Bumblebee is viable** | BGE-M3 declares `architectures: ["XLMRobertaModel"]` and Bumblebee maps `XLMRobertaModel => Bumblebee.Text.Roberta`. Its sparse/ColBERT heads are two loose `.pt` linear layers, not part of the HF model — so they are portable to Nx, which could remove Python entirely. Ladder in `docs/ELIXIR.md`. |
| `.credo.exs` from `gen.config`, patched | A hand-written config silently **replaced** the default check set (3 checks instead of 69). Never hand-roll it. |

## Open questions

- **pg_bigm** — not in Homebrew; compile from source against brew Postgres 18. *(Task #10)*
- **BGE-M3 multi-vector in Nx** — port the two linear heads and drop the sidecar, or
  keep a bake-time sidecar? Decide in Phase 1 once dense works. *(Task #11)*
- **Tibetan `botok`** has no Elixir/Rust equivalent, so the sidecar survives until at
  least Phase 5 regardless — bake-time only.

## Surprises and gotchas

Each of these cost real time; they are recorded so they cost it only once.

- **`mise trust` is path-keyed.** An early `mise install` silently no-op'd because the
  project config was untrusted, and the global config won. Renaming the project
  directory invalidated the trust again.
- **In an umbrella, `File.cwd!()` is not the umbrella root** — mix runs each child app
  from its own directory. `config :pramana, :project_root` is pinned at compile time
  via `Path.expand("..", __DIR__)` instead.
- **CBETA keeps its apparatus in `<back>`**, not inline, keyed to `<anchor>` positions
  in the body. Assuming inline `<app>` yields empty lemmas.
- **`<lb/>` also appears inside `<back>` lemmas** (which reproduce body text). Treating
  those as line boundaries invented 35 phantom lines with **duplicate anchors** —
  non-unique URNs. `<lb/>` handling is body-only.
- **`<lem>` spans `<lb/>`.** Buffering lemma text and flushing at `</lem>` attributes
  the whole lemma to whichever line closed it.
- **A second URN regex silently disabled the guard.** The quote-pairing pattern's
  character class omitted `:`, so it captured `pramana:cbeta.T` and never matched a
  real URN; every citation fell through to existence-checking and altered quotes
  passed. There is now one `@urn_source`. The test that missed it asserted only `ok?`,
  which is true either way — hence `verified_quotes` in the result.
- **Elixir map typespecs are exact.** An undeclared key in `Corpus.span()` made the
  spec unsatisfiable, and dialyzer narrowed `resolve/1` to its error branch and
  reported every downstream `verdict == :ok` as impossible. Same class of bug in
  `URN.t()`'s `raw` field.
- **Ecto schemas do not define `t/0`**, and Mix/ExUnit are absent from dialyzer's
  default PLT (`plt_add_apps: [:mix, :ex_unit]`).
- **`phx_new` is 1.8.9 while `phoenix` is 1.8.11** — they version separately.
- **Homebrew Postgres uses your OS username**, not `postgres/postgres`.
